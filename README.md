### What is this repository for? ###

*Edward Lynx (EL)* is a management consulting firm specialising in leadership development. The main
office is in Sweden and we also have offices in China, Russia, Czech Republic and the United Arab
Emirates. We have an existing toolset that consists of Lynx 360 Feedback, Lynx Progress tool, Lynx
management Team Tool and Lynx Team Tool that is driven by a web based platform. We would now
like to extend our toolset by developing a mobile application that can be used by our customers for
performance reviews, goal settings, and follow up of different leadership development initiatives.
We are therefore looking for a mobile app development partner that can guide us through this
project and help us deliver a great app. Edward Lynx should be able to take a mostly passive role in
this project and the development partner that we select should have all the necessary resources,
experience and knowledge to drive this project successfully in terms of communication, meeting
deadlines, gathering required information etc.

### How do I get set up? ###

The repository contains all the needed project resources and third-party packages needed by the app. All you need to do is clone the repository and run the **.xcworkspace** file.
